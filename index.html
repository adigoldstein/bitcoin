        Ever had a case where you wished you had bought something in the past that eventually went up significantly in
        value? Perhaps a plot in a low-value district which is now worth ten times more? Does that ring a bell? With so
        many amazing stories surfacing like Kristoffer Koch, Erik Finman, and Jay Smith*, it seems the enormous rise of
        Bitcoin has been officially making ordinary people who invested in Bitcoin into millionaires.
      </p>
      <p>
        Monday marked the seventh anniversary of what is said to be the first recorded instance of Bitcoins being used
        in a real-world transaction. Over the course of seven years, Bitcoin's value has multiplied 879,999 times. If an
        investor had decided to spend five dollars on about 2,000 Bitcoins back then, that stake would be worth $4.4
        million today. With $1,200 spent on some 480,000 Bitcoins, the investor would be worth at least $1.1 billion
        today.

          At first, Bitcoin didn’t really catch on, and it was solely the domain of the early adopters. There were very
          few businesses which accepted bitcoin as a payment method, and it was something which was almost frowned upon
          by most governments. As more and more businesses and governments accepted bitcoin, it gradually went up in
          value, more and more people were starting to embrace the idea of a decentralized currency, and as <a

          people
          jumped on board</a>, the price began to rise. Since the beginning of the year 2017, the value of Bitcoin
          spiked
          after gaining legitimacy in countries like Japan.

        “Bitcoin is better than currency.” - Bill Gates
      </div>
      <p>
        The main advantage of bitcoin is that it is decentralized – meaning, there’s no central bank or government which
        controls it. This freedom is one of the reasons why Investors have come to see the currency as something of a
        safe-haven-asset in a problematic geopolitical world — and there's been plenty of that in recent months in
        Europe, Russia, Brazil and the United States. There is also an additional advantage in Bitcoin – there is a
        mathematical limitation to the number of Bitcoins that can be created, which means – no printing money, so the
        rules of economy work perfectly. Where there is a limited supply of something, and the demand goes up, the price
        goes up along with it.

        Wences Casares has been called Bitcoin’s “patient zero” by the Silicon Valley elite. He got Bill Gates, Reid
        Hoffman, and countless other luminaries into Bitcoin at gatherings of the rich and famous such as Sun Valley.

            Billionaire businessman Wences Casares says it’s not too late for people interested in Bitcoin.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The Argentinian-born Casares has founded an internet service provider, a video game company, and a bank, plus
          he sits on the board of PayPal, but it’s Bitcoin that Casares says he’s dedicating the rest of his life to,
          and he now runs a startup called Xapo that stores Bitcoin. At a dinner organized by the cryptocurrency policy
          group Coin Center in New York last night, Casares delivered the keynote speech, including some advice about
          how to get into Bitcoin.
        </p>
        <p>
          The formula, according to Casares? <a

          1% or less of what you own, invest in Bitcoin with it</a>, “You either
          lose one percent of your net worth, which most people can take, or you make millions.” he told a room of
          cryptocurrency advocates at the Westin in Times Square.

            Experts such as Wence Casares predict a single Bitcoin will be worth $500,000 by the year 2030.

        <p>
          Casares pegs the odds of bitcoin failing completely and going to zero dollars at 20%. “If it fails, it will be
          worthless,” he says. “If it succeeds, in five to seven years a single Bitcoin will be worth more than a
          million dollars.” He puts the chances of success at greater than 50%.
        </p>
        <p>
          Casares has an interesting reply for those people who believe they have already “missed out” on the bitcoin
          train and are afraid that they are joining too late. He said “Even those <a
          href="https://content.etoro.com/lp/bitcoin/?dl=30001956&utm_medium=Affiliate&utm_source=65381&utm_content=9157&utm_serial=VkdG8Lqt5xGySIis6nVuIgOhmaAAAAAAAmblTAAAAAAA&utm_campaign=VkdG8Lqt5xGySIis6nVuIgOhmaAAAAAAAmblTAAAAAAA&utm_term=">who
          bought Bitcoin at high
          prices just a month ago</a>
          have done “spectacularly well”.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        But it’s not just Bitcoin making the headlines, the crypto-currency market is spearheaded by another
        crypto-currency called the “Ethereum” and if you haven’t heard this name yet hear this: Its price grew over
        5400% in the last 6 months alone. In fact, the price of Ethereum grew from $7 in the beginning of 2017 to a high
        of over $400 in June 2017, and there are very good reasons for it. While Bitcoin is mostly used for consumer
        payment transactions, Ethereum has been adopted by the corporate world. In fact, Ethereum has already been
        embraced by companies such as Microsoft, Intel, Toyota, J.P Morgan, as well as many other companies which are
        all official members of The Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA). This corporate acceptance ads a lot to the
        legitimacy of Ethereum as a currency, and also makes it the perfect “companion” to your crypto-currency
        investment portfolio.
      </p>
      <p>
        With all the headlines about Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto-currencies on the rise, maybe you’re thinking
        to get in on the game, but you’re not sure where to start. Wondering where to get started? We’ll show you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before you do this, though, you should note that investing in just one currency is not advisable due to the high
        volatility of crypto currencies. This is why we recommend to invest in a portfolio of crypto-currencies, rather
        than just concentrate in one particular currency.

        <h2>What do you need to do to invest in crypto-currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum?</h2>
        <h3>Step One</h3>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://content.etoro.com/lp/bitcoin/?dl=30001956&utm_medium=Affiliate&utm_source=65381&utm_content=9157&utm_serial=VkdG8Lqt5xGySIis6nVuIgOhmaAAAAAAAmblTAAAAAAA&utm_campaign=VkdG8Lqt5xGySIis6nVuIgOhmaAAAAAAAmblTAAAAAAA&utm_term=">Click
            this link</a> to register a free account in Etoro. Why Etoro? eToro is a fully regulated platform and a
          brand you can trust. There are endless reviews about eToro world-wide, and people are very happy with their
          services. It is much safer to buy bitcoins with a regulated brand like eToro than any other service.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, there is one amazing advantage that separates eToro from the pack, and it’s called the “Copy
          People” option.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the people lack the financial knowledge and time to build a crypto-investment portfolio. eToro, which
          is a social platform, offers a very unique and innovative solution to this problem: Instead of building your
          own portfolio and having to monitor it every second, you can use the eToro search tool to find eToro’s top
          Crypto traders, watch their stats and interact with them, then with the click of a button you can
          automatically set eToro to copy all of their trades for you. You can even interact with other people who are
          also copying their trades.
        </p>
        <h3>Step Two</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://content.etoro.com/lp/bitcoin/?dl=30001956&utm_medium=Affiliate&utm_source=65381&utm_content=9157&utm_serial=VkdG8Lqt5xGySIis6nVuIgOhmaAAAAAAAmblTAAAAAAA&utm_campaign=VkdG8Lqt5xGySIis6nVuIgOhmaAAAAAAAmblTAAAAAAA&utm_term=">Make a deposit with the amount you wish to invest in bitcoin</a> - eToro accepts £ , $, € and also many other
          local currencies</p>
        <img src="images/etoro.png" alt="etoro">
        <h3> Step Three</h3>
        <p>
          Once you’ve made your deposit, choose anyone from eToro’s top crypto traders. At the time of writing these
          lines, “Jay Nemesis” (Real name: Jay Edward Smith), an elite popular investor, is by far the best
          crypto-trader with the highest results on eToro’s network, as you can see in the below screenshot, he had
          already made 170.32% profit on his investments in the crypto-currencies market. Feel free to watch his
          portfolio performance, interact with him and ask him any questions, he’s usually very quick to respond. Once
          you are ready, move to step 4.
        </p>

Simply select the amount, for example, $550 or any
          amount which you wish to invest in crypto-currencies. You can set the “stop loss” to the default system
          choice.
        </p>
        <img src="images/copy-trader.jpg" alt="Copy trader">
        <h3>Step Five</h3>

        Congratulations! You are now part of the community. Since you are copying all of the trades of an experienced
        crypto-trader, every time the prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other crypto currency rises, the investment
        portfolio of the experienced trader rises along with it - and your portfolio consequently rises along with it
        exactly at the same time. Think about this – If 6 years ago you’d invested $500 in Bitcoin, that $500 would now
        be worth over $4,000,000. Now imagine copying multiple investments on multiple cryptocurrencies made by an
        experienced crypto-trader. You won’t need to wait six years to see results.
